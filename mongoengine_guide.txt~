This is a guide for using Mongoengine.

Import the document model itself (subclassed under db.Document), and call
.save() for saving the document and .objects to return the objects.
```
>>> User.objects
[<User u'vasaulys'>]
```

Also, call .to_mongo() to create a 'SON' object and .to_dict() to output
to a python dictionary. From here, one should be able to call jsonify()
from the flask library to output to json. This function is used in a view
function, like render_template()
